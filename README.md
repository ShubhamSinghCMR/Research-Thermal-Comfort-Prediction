# Research - Thermal Comfort Prediction

A research-focused repository for studying **thermal comfort prediction** using **data-driven, statistical, and machine learning approaches**.

This repository serves as a **central and evolving research codebase**, supporting exploratory analysis, environment-specific and generalized modeling, feature engineering, ensemble methods, and comparative evaluation across thermal comfort studies.

Designed to remain **method-agnostic and extensible**, the repository will expand as new research questions, datasets, and modeling strategies are introduced in the domain of human thermal comfort.
